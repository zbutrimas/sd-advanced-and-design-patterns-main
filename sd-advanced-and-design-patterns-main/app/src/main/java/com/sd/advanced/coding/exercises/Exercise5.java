    Design the Joiner<T> class, which in the constructor will take a separator (string) and have a join() method
    that allows you to specify any number of T-type objects. This method will return a string joining all passed
    elements by calling their toString() method and separating them with a separator.
    e.g. for Integers and separator "-" it should return: 1-2-3-4
